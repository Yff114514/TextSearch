  Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born. So one day he asked God, "They tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow, but how am I going to live there being so small and helpless?"
  God replied, "Among the many angels, I chose one for you. She will be waiting for you and will take care of you."
  But the child wasn't sure he really wanted to go. "But tell me, here in Heaven, I don't do anything else but sing and smile, that's enough for me to be happy."
  God said,"Your angel will sing for you and will also smile for you every day. And you will feel your angel's love and be happy."
  "And how am I going to be able to understand when people talk to me," the child continued, "If I don't know the language that men talk?"
  God patted him on the head and said, "Your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear, and with much patience and care, your angel will teach you how to speak."
  The child looked up at the God saying,"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?"
  God smiled a the child ans saying "Your angel will place your hands together and will teach you how to pray."
  "I've heard that on earth there are bad men, who will protect me?"The child continued.
  "But I will always be sad because I will not see you anymore," the child continued warily.
  God smiled on the young one. "Your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the way for you to come back to me, even though I will always be next to you."
  "Your angel will defend you even if it means risking her life!"
  At that moment there was much peace in Heaven, but voices from earth could already be heard. The child knew he had to start on his journey very soon. He asked God one more question, softly, "Oh God, if I am about to leave now, please tell me my angel's name."
  God touched the child on the shoulder and answered, "Your angel's name is not hard to remember. You will simply call her Mommy."
